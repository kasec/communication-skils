# The Pythian Games in Delphi

The birth of music festivals in Ancient Greece (6th century BC)

<!--
The Pythian Games in Delphi, Ancient Greece, are perhaps the earliest example of festivals involving music. One of the four Panhellenic Games, the Pythian Games, held in honour of Apollo (the god of music), were set apart from the pack by the fact that they hosted musical competitions known as mousikos agon, as well as the usual athletics and shows of strength. Founded sometime in the 6th century BC, the Pythian Games, a precursor of the Olympic Games, featured dance, art and musical displays. Moving into the 10th century BC, Greece was still the hotbed of musical happenings. Every spring, the three-day Festival of the Vine Flower bought talents in togas to the city of Athens. Even more enthusiastic about boozing than modern festival-goers, the Ancient Greeks started the party with a silent drinking contest before enjoying song and dance performances.

<!-- The first Oktoberfest was held in October of 1810 to celebrate the wedding between Crown Prince Ludwig of Bavaria and Princess Therese of Saxony-Hildburghausen, according to the official Oktoberfest website. The citizens of Munich were invited to the fields in front of the city gates, now called Theresienwiese (Therese’s meadow), to join the party. It lasted for five days—October 12-17—each filled with food, beer, parades, and music. The final event was a horse race around the edge of town. -->

<!-- When you hear the word “Oktoberfest,” your mind probably conjures up images of beer, pretzels, lederhosen, and more beer.  -->
