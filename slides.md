# Be the question asker

<!--
1. Be the question asker

Put the spotlight on them and don't expect the favor back. Focus on learning something new outside

2. Find a topic that excites you

# 5. Ask hypothetical questions.

<!--
5. Ask hypothetical questions.
Take a tip from the table-talk cards and give "if" situations so your convo partner can draw on their imagination instead of feeling blocked by reality.
"If you had 3 wishes ..."
"If you were in xyz situation ..."
"Would you rather a or b ..."

# 6. Ask why

<!--
6. Ask why
Asking "why" reveals someone's values and priorities. It tells you more than
"What" ever could, and you'll get more information to ask even more questions.

<!--
